<title> Alan Turing: Known for decoding encryption of German Enigma machines and helping develop the first modern computer! </title>

  <b><h1>Alan Turing</h1></b>
  <h3>Date of Birth: 06/23/1912</h3>
  <h3>Date of Death: 06/7/1954</h3>

<p4>The <i>British mathematician</i> <b>Alan Turing</b> made many contributions to the field of computer science.
During <b>World War II</b>, Turing <i><b>discovered techniques to decrypt German codes</i></b>. He invented conceptual computing machines
and formalized key ideas, such as the famous test for artificial intelligence. He laid the foundation for modern computing.
Despite personal issues, Turing's visionary research on algorithms helped define artificial intelligence and gave rise to useful concepts for computer programming.
His groundbreaking work established the tenets that enabled the <i>Information Age</i>, though tragically, he did not live long enough to see them. </p4>
